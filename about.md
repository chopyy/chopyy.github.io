# What is this website about?

Main objective of this website is to keep things in mind. Some posts could be also helpful to others. Most of the posts will be in English. Off-topic related stuff is in German.

# Daily Work

I work as a software development engineer in the area of AUTOSAR Adaptive for Vector Informatik GmbH, Germany. I'm passionate about  automotive systems engineering, functional safety, programming (programming in C++ and C in particular), control engineering, digital signal processing, embedded and real-time systems.

Being open-minded, innovative, creative during design and implementation phase is important to me. At the same time of being creative, I think it's mandatory to rely on proven-in-use concepts, standards and tools to get things done.

# Education

* Master of Engineering (MEng) in mechatronics 
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in drive systems and mechatronics

# Publications

During my time as a research engineer in the area of human-robot collaboration I had the chance to be one of the authors of three papers.

* Daniel Tuchscherer and Frank Tränkle. "A Multi-Platform Modern C++ Framework for Safety-Critical Embedded Software." In Proceedings of the Embedded World Conference 2018.
* Daniel Tuchscherer, Alexander Weibert, and Frank Tränkle. 2016. "Modern C++ as a Modeling Language for Automated Driving and Human-Robot Collaboration." In Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 19th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS '16). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 136-142. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2976767.2976772
