# Work

Hi, this is Daniel, R&D engineer at Heilbronn University, Germany. I'm working in the fields of human-robot collaboration and highly automated driving. I'm passionate about programming - especially in C++ and C, control theory, digital signal processing, embedded and real-time systems. I'm enthusiastic about how to improve embedded software development in the future.

# Education

I have a BSc degree in electric motor systems and mechatronics.

# What is this website about ?

The blog entries on the front page of this site is some kind of reminder. The purpose is to keep some of the things in mind and to have a walkthrough at a later time. E.g. I do not configure and compile custom real-time Linux kernels at a daily basis, because I mainly do software development in C / C++ and automotive systems engineering. Maybe some of the blog entries are also useful to some other people.
