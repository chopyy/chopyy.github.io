# "How would you describe yourself and your work?"

Hi, this is Daniel, R&D engineer at Heilbronn University, Germany. I'm working in the innovative areas of human-robot collaboration and highly automated driving. I'm passionate about programming - programming in C++ and C in particular, control engineering, digital signal processing, embedded and real-time systems.

I'm enthusiastic about how to improve the embedded software development. I really like being open-minded, innovative and creative during design and implementation phase. What's of real importance for me is to think out-of-the-box or as *Elon Musk* would say: "Don't just follow the trend". At the same time of being innovative, it's mandatory to rely on proven-in-use concepts, standards and tools to get things done.

# Education

I have a BSc degree in drive systems (electrical machines) and mechatronics. In parallel to my work as a research assistant I'm completing my Master's degree in mechatronics.

# What is this website about ?

Main objective of this archive is to keep things in my mind and to have a guideline at a later time point. Some posts may be also helpful to other people. Most of the posts are in English. Off-topic related stuff is mostly in German.

# Special interests

* real-time C++
* embedded systems
* efficient, elegant programming
* static code analysis
* continuous improvement of software development process

# Things i like

* design-patterns
* clean, maintainable, reusable & readable code
* object-oriented and generic design
* sleek code style
* simplification

# Things i don't like

* Every engineer I know is confronted with over-engineering.
