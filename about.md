# Work

Hi, this is Daniel, R&D engineer at Heilbronn University, Germany. I'm working in the fields of human-robot collaboration and highly automated driving. I'm passionate about programming - especially in C++ and C, control theory, digital signal processing, embedded and real-time systems. I'm enthusiastic about how to improve embedded software development in the future.

# Education

I have a BSc degree in electric motor systems and mechatronics.
