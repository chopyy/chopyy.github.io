> I appreciate that there's an increasing interest in using the C++ programming language for (automotive) embedded software development. Sentences like "I really need to become a C++ expert" or "we don't need to hire automotive engineers anymore, but C++ experts of any domain" reflect people care too much about being the best coder and the programming language in use. However, I experience that the programming language only covers one small aspect of the full engineering needed to successfully develop complex embedded systems in the automotive domain. We need to focus on the "big picture".

There's a great talk available from James Coplien with the title "What went wrong with the IT-industry?" [^1]. In his talk
James Coplien quotes an article [^2] from Jess Watson who works for Amazon to underline his statements. I couldn't say it better:

> "The most valuable asset in the software industry is the synthesis of programming skill and deep context in the business problem domain, in one skull."

and

> "... the programming skill in the abscence of business domain knowledge is becoming increasingly worthless."

In my experience, even hundreds of programming experts that are focussed on programming exclusively won't deliver your
software in a better quality and/or faster. Developing fancy C++ code for instance is simple. Producing a lot of code is
simple.

What's not that simple: Having the *big picture* in mind to develop and ship a product that brings value to the
customer in first place, but to the developers, too.

With people having the "big picture" in mind I mean system engineers which combine their *domain knowledge* and
programming expertise, instead of putting too much gravity on programming only. Programming is only one aspect
during development of complex embedded systems and software.

System engineers - as the name points out - care about the system and the engineering processes as a whole. To name a
few examples system engineers care about the user, the team, about continuous improvement and quality management, about
requirements, the design, verification, validation and project management.

It isn't about the programming language for me. Don't get me wrong: We need C++ experts that have deep
knowledge on how to apply C++11/C++14 as effective as possible for their domain. But what would be even better is if this
mindset of a system engineer would be established further. Having motivated people working in a team that use their
domain knowledge, have a rich set of *soft skills* and use their expertise in coding is the best.
