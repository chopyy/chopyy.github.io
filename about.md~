# Work

Hi, this is Daniel, R&D engineer at Heilbronn University located in the south of Germany. I'm dealing with robotics and autonomos driver assistance. I'm passionate about programming especially in C and C++, control theory, automotive, embedded and real-time systems.

Plus, there's an exception... I like writing documentations and reports.

# Studies

Currently I'm owning a BSc degree in electric motor systems and mechatronics. My thesis was based on a research work on the use of C++ in safety critical systems.

There are currently some publications pending. I will give an update on this soon.
