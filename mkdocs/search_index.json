It is recommended to start the Eclipse IDE over the specific batch file delivered by the PX4 Toolchain: \nStart -\n PX4 Eclipse\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're working on a 64-bit system there may be an issue starting Eclipse, because of the 64-Bit JRE / JDK. In this case you have to download either the JRE or JDK 32-bit from (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). \nIf Eclipse starts up it will automatically assume that your PX4 toolchain is located under C:\\px4. The PX4 Eclipse will use C:\\px4\\workspace as its workspace folder.\n\n\nImport the existing Makefile Project\n\n\n\n\nAfter starting Eclipse you have to import the PX4 Firmware Makefile project.
